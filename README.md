# simple-caldav

> caldav in JavaScript; made easy.

## Note on Completeness

The caldav and ICS specifications are large. Additionally, I'm not sure I ever
want to implement them completely. But I saw the need some a simple module that
works with e.g. [radicale](https://radicale.org/3.0.html) and provides decent
developer experience. simple-caldav is that attempt.
